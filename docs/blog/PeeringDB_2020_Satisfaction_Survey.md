# PeeringDB 2020 Satisfaction Survey
PeeringDB wants input from network operators, exchange operators, facility providers, content distributors and anyone who uses our interconnection database. We are running [an anonymous satisfaction survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/f7be5236) until 23:59 UTC on 20 November 2020 and would like your feedback to help us make PeeringDB more useful to everyone involved in connecting networks.

We haven’t had the diversity of input we’d like in previous surveys, so we are making an extra effort to reach parts of the community who weren’t aware of our previous surveys. We're telling you here and we are teaming up with partners around the world to get the message out.

> Input from all PeeringDB users on what is important and what needs improving is essential. Telling us what you value and what you need us to improve will help us make PeeringDB better for you and make peering easier for all.
 
*Steve McManus, PeeringDB Product Committee Chair*

The survey will help us understand what is important to you and how satisfied you are with what we are doing. We will use your responses to focus our product roadmap on the improvements that will make things better for you. If you have specific comments or suggestions we’d love you to leave them along with your ratings.

This is the first survey we are making available in multiple languages. [In this survey](https://surveyhero.com/c/f7be5236) we are using the six UN languages for the questions. That said, we’re happy with people providing free text comments in whichever language they are happiest expressing themselves.

We’ll share the results and the new product roadmap early in 2021.

If you have a specific idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic mailing lists or create an issue directly on GitHub. If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at support@peeringdb.com.

PeeringDB is a freely available, user-maintained, database of networks, and the go-to location for interconnection data. The database facilitates the global interconnection of networks at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), data centers, and other interconnection facilities, and is the first stop in making interconnection decisions.
