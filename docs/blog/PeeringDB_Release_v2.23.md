This release includes a key feature that comes out of the [Data Ownership TF](https://docs.peeringdb.com/taskforce/dataownership/), which was established to clarify who is authoritative for data about networks where multiple members participate, like IXPs. This change means that all networks will need to have a technical POC when they publish a connection to an exchange network. This change will help all the parties on the exchange resolve technical issues efficiently. It was proposed and discussed in [Github issues #826](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/826).
