# Contributing Code to PeeringDB Just Got Easier

Have you ever wanted to contribute code to improve PeeringDB but found it too challenging to set up a test environment? The good news is that spinning up a development environment is now a single button press.

We have radically reduced the barrier for volunteer developers to contribute code to PeeringDB. Until now, even if a code fix was relatively simple, the process for testing it before making the contribution was a challenge. Now, you can spin up a PeeringDB development instance with a single command. You’ll be able to test changes locally and then submit pull requests when you’re ready to publish your contribution. It was proposed and discussed in GitHub issues #724. 

Andy Davidson, CTO of Asteroid says: “*I recently developed some code against the PeeringDB OAuth instance for [https://trackbgp.com](https://trackbgp.com). But it was hard to get a development environment set up. Now I can spin up a development environment in less time than it takes to boil a kettle.*”

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our low traffic mailing lists or create an issue directly on GitHub. If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at support@peeringdb.com.
