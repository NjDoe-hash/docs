# Changes to Contacts Marked as Private
<mark>Did you know PeeringDB’s 2021 User survey is open until 8 October? It takes about 3 minutes and will set the direction for PeeringDB in 2022. Please [click here](https://surveyhero.com/c/peeringdb2021usersurvey) to tell us where to improve.</mark>

We are removing the “Private” status from Points of Contact in PeeringDB. This status was carried over from v1 of PeeringDB but is no longer useful: it just confuses users.

It will no longer be available when a Point of Contact is created. We will not surprise anyone by changing the status of any contacts marked as “Private” though.

It will no longer be available as a status for newly created contacts. And if your organization has one or more contacts marked as “Private” in PeeringDB, admin users will be prompted to make a decision between two statuses when they next log in. [These are](https://docs.peeringdb.com/howto/manage-permissions/):

* Users: only other PeeringDB users can see the Point of Contact
* Public: the record is shown to anonymous users as well as authenticated users

If you are an administrator for your organization’s entry in PeeringDB, you need to decide which of the Points of Contact you publish should only be disclosed to authenticated PeeringDB users and which should be published to anonymous users.

If you have an idea to improve PeeringDB you can share it on our [low traffic mailing lists](https://docs.peeringdb.com/#mailing-lists) or create an [issue](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues) directly on GitHub. If you find a data quality issue, please let us know at support@peeringdb.com.
