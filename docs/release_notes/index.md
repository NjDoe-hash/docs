| [#251 - Limit number of concurrent affiliation requests per user](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/251) | In order to reduce organization affiliation request spamming, the number of pending organization requests has been limited to 5. |
| [#295 Desk pro tickets -> DeskPRO tickets](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/295)  | This is a bug fix and only affects the Admin UI. |

| [#452 - Org/Network name of a sponsor should not link to /sponsors, only the sponsor badge should](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/452) | This is a bug fix. From now on only when clicking on the sponsor badge will direct to the sponsor page. |
| [#462 - Route-server URL starting with ssh://](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/462) |  |
| [#539 - Add attribute 'operational' to 'netixlan'](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/539) | This is a new feature and allows networks to give early notice to their peers that they soon will show up at an IXP. There is a new check box when adding an IXP connection. By default, a connection is considered operational and the box is ticked. When the connection is still in provisioning status, please untick the box. When viewing, the warning glyphicon is shown right to the network name. The correspondent API object netixlan is enhanced by a boolean field operational defaulting to true. This feature is in line with the [Data Ownership Policy](../gov/misc/2020-04-06_PeeringDB_Data_Ownership_Policy_Document_v1.0.pdf). |
| [#548 - containerize server](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/548) | Internal software deployment system has been changed to use containers which reduces time spent by the ops team for deployments, allows for better scaling, and reduces the cost of entry for new developers to write and test their code. |

| [#557 - Show all languages on beta, even if translation is not ready for prod](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/557) | As soon as a new translation is starting it is available on the beta to help the translators and to encourage the community for input. |
| [#598 - bug caused by the org affiliationship request without an asn](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/598) | This is a bug fix and is only relevant for the PeeringDB Admin Committee. |
| [#609 - When creating an ix via the API also return ixlan_id and ixpfx_id](https://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb/issues/609) | When creating an IX record via API, the call will also return the implicitly created ixlan_id and ixpfx_id. This makes it simpler and reduces the number of calls that need to be made to the API. |
