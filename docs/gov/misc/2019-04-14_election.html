Having been involved since the PeeringDB’s inception, I am impressed and proud that the PeeringDB has become vital to the Internet interconnection ecosystem. I cannot give enough thanks to the current board under Aaron’s leadership, and volunteers like Greg who do not get enough credit. It would be a deep honor to continue working with this group.
</p>
<p>
While the PeeringDB is amazing today, there is much more it could do to ease the lives of engineers and peering coordinators. I believe my long tenure with the PeeringDB, work with multiple IXPs, experience on other non-profit Internet-related boards, and decades working in the industry make me uniquely qualified to help.
</p>
<p>
My primary goals:
</p>
<p>
1. Ensure the neutrality of the PeeringDB and guarantee users control their records.
</p>
<p>
2. Provide a stable and secure platform.
</p>
<p>
3. Be responsive to user requests.
</p>
<p>
4. Add features.
</p>
<p>
The order is intentional. Features are important, but it must come after the other priorities. As an example, I fought to ensure importing data from IXF was opt-in. Some wanted to import all data automatically, without user request or input. I believe the admins / board should not decide what is best for you. It is your record, you should have complete control.
</p>
<p>
If you agree the platform must be vehemently agnostic, and leave no doubt users own their own records, then I am your champion.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I would like to thank each of you for using the PeeringDB. The DB is only as useful as the members make it, and you have made it the most important repository of peering information on the Internet. It is truly humbling to have been involved in the canonical example of a grass-roots community effort showing value and bringing everyone together.

I’m a Senior Network Architect and interconnect strategist with the
not-for-profit network NORDUnet (AS2603). Our main settlements is where
the winter is definitely always coming and we provide connectivity for
Research & Education network within the whole of Winterfe… Scandinavia.
With recent additions of the Baltic States, Poland, Russia and the
Netherlands our network is growing to be quite
substantial and this does not come without a extensive
peering-footprint.  What sets us apart from many others of our friends
in the R&E World is that we are very keen on peering and has always
tried to keep up on what’s happening in the peering-world, both in our
own R&E sector and in the commercial sector.
</p>
<p>
I'm a frequent visitor to any meetings, forums or *NOG’s that has any
sort of peering or interconnect-track. We love peering and love to talk
about it, especially when it comes to automation we are quite far ahead
and the PeeringDB API is the success-factor behind our autopeering
functionalities.
</p>
<p>
I believe that PeeringDB is the best thing that has happened since
sliced bread and one of the very key factors for its success is the
ability for PeeringDB to stay neutral and unbiased in all aspects. Being
in the board this would be my top-priority above all and with the fact
that I represent a organization that knows a thing or two about
non-profit I think I can provide a lot of valuable input
on how organizations can be truly transparent. The data in the DB
belongs to the users, and no one else.

I'm running again for the PeeringDB Board to be an advocate for users of the platform. Although PDB2.0 is out for three years still much support is needed. We also have an opportunity to make the platform more automated and user-friendly. The governance framework is in place and we were able to get PeeringDB well funded via a couple of generous sponsors.
</p>
<p>
I've been a PeeringDB Admin for more than 11 years. I've already worked in the nooks and crannies of the platform, and know where we can improve it. I've been very closely involved in the support functions of PeeringDB, supporting queries for customer care. We need a reliable and responsive support desk. Besides leading the Admin committee I help on the Product and Outreach Committees.
</p>
<p>
As a member of the Board, I'd focus on making 2.0 a stable platform, ensuring that we have all the features and data that our users need to run their daily business. Moreover I would also continue my work in the PDB Product and Outreach Committees.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB will be a primary source - globally - for accurate, updated and standardized data about networks, IXPs, data centers, colocation providers and more. I've been driving this process forward with all relevant parties, and I'll work diligently to ensure all IXPs globally develop their IXPA interface to make this a useful tool for the worldwide community.
</p>
<p>
I bring 30 years of experience and expertise in the ISP and IXP industry. I'm co-founder and after 15 years as CTO/COO now an evangelist of DE-CIX. I have a close eye on the global interconnection industry regularly attending NANOG, RIPE, APRICOT and other key global fora.
</p>
<p>
I love what I do, and I'd like to continue to serve this awesome industry as a member of the PeeringDB Board.
