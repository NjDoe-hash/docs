</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal
business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 positions of the Board of Directors, 3 of which are up for 
election this year. A Director term is 2 years.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2017: Candidates may submit their
candidacy and maximum 300 word statement, as determined by POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command,
or revisions to their statement, to
secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2017: Ballots, with candidate statements, will be submitted to the
PeeringDB Governance mailing list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>
Hi - I'm Matt Griswold and I am currently Chairman and CTO for United
IX, an Internet exchange in Chicago. I have been coding and launching
technology companies since 1999. I am extremely passionate about
peering and Internet communities and have volunteered Euro-IX, NANOG,
Open-IX and PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
I started providing coding support and upgrades for PeeringDB in 2011.
Shortly after, I became an admin to assist in answering support
tickets, and gain a better understanding of user base and the
feature/improvement requests being made. After gaining a good insight
to the use cases, I began writing PeeringDB 2.0 to fulfill many of the
community requests for features and improvements. Getting PeeringDB 2.0
in beta has been a huge step forward, but there is still a substantial
amount of work to complete the vision for 2.0. Along with adding new
functionality and data objects, I want to ensure we maintain data
validity and interoperate with other community resources such as IXF
and ixp-memberlist schema to make PeeringDB a one stop canonical source
for any business needs.
</p>
<p>
This is an exciting time for everyone involved with PeeringDB. As a
member of the board, I will focus my efforts implementing even more
features from the long queue of requests and ideas and stay deeply
involved with the community. I sincerely hope to have the opportunity
to continue to contribute any way I can, and drive progress as
PeeringDB evolves. Let's revolutionize how interconnection databases
work and make the world a better place!
