Peering is essential part of my day to day job. PeeringDB has made peering easy, effective and organized. I believe there are many more things peeringdb can achieve under strong leadership. I would like to devote my time to drive peeringdb in the areas its members see needs improvement while driving new business ideas to ensure peeringdb and its members are satisfied with service.
</p>
<p>
I work fulltime at Yahoo as Director of Infrastructure Planning and Acquisition responsible for XXX M annual opex budget including Interconnection strategy and operations. Prior to that I have handled peering for Microsoft and L-Root.
</p>
<p>
Thank you for the opportunity and consideration

I'm running again for the PeeringDB Board to be an advocate for users of the platform. Now that PDB2.0 is out for little more than one year we see how beneficial it is and how much support is still needed. We also have an opportunity to make the platform more automated and user-friendly. The new governance framework is in place and we were able to get PeeringDB well funded via a couple of generous sponsors.
</p>
<p>
I've been a PeeringDB Admin for more than nine years. I've already worked in the nooks and crannies of the platform, and know where we can improve it. I've been very closely involved in the support functions of PeeringDB, supporting queries for customer care. We need a reliable and responsive support desk.
</p>
<p>
As a member of the Board, I'd focus on making 2.0 a stable platform, ensuring that we have all the features and data that our users need to run their daily business. Moreover I would also continue my work in the PDB Product Committee.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB will be a primary source - globally - for accurate, updated and standardized data about networks, IXPs, data centers, colocation providers and more. I've been driving this process forward with all relevant parties, and I'll work diligently to ensure all IXPs globally develop their IXPA interface to make this a useful tool for the worldwide community.
</p>
<p>
I bring more than 26 years of experience and expertise in the ISP and IXP industry. I'm co-founder and after 15 years as CTO/COO now an evangelist of DE-CIX. I have a close eye on the global interconnection industry regularly attending NANOG, RIPE, APRICOT and other key global fora.
</p>
<p>
I love what I do, and I'd like to continue to serve this awesome industry as a member of the PeeringDB Board.
