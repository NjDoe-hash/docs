<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the

least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

election this year. A Director term is 2 years.

candidacy and maximum 300 word statement, as determined by POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command,

<p>Denis Fondras</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I am a french network contractor and network operator (AS60983). I have a
12-year experience in networks and networked systems. In a previous job, I was
in charge of planning and establishing peering relationship.
</p>
<p>
I am also the secretary of AuvernIX, a local IXP. As a really small non-profit
association, my role in AuvernIX is as much to write reports than to manage
contacts with other network operators and other IXP and do the plumbing. I am
also a part-time lecturer at the local university (Universit√© d'Auvergne) where I
teach Internet technologies.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB has always been an amazing tool to find informations about where to
peer with a network and it eases the work of small network owners a lot. As a
member I try to ensure the database is exhaustive and accurate.

<p>
PeeringDB is one of the most important online resources for network operators, and as such I believe it should remain independent, free of charge, neutral and foremost: a pragmatic tool for everyday use.
</p>
<p>
Through the years, I've built up useful experience leading and participating in a number of community-driven projects such as the NLNOG foundation (as chairman), the IETF GROW working group (as co-chair) and PeeringDB itself as vice-president. You can find a detailed overview here: <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobsnijders'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobsnijders</a>
</p>
<p>
I believe that for the board to maintain a balanced and fair view, multiple facets of this industry should be represented: Content, IXP, Datacenter &amp; IP carrier. As an architect for a global carrier I will contribute my perspective and help extend the reach of PeeringDB to IP network operators world-wide.
</p>
<p>
I've helped run PeeringDB for a number of years, I'm currently serving as a member of its Board of Directors and as chair of the Operations Committee.
</p>
<p>
I hope to be given the trust and opportunity to continue to guide PeeringDB forward!
