<p>
Bylaws at <a href="http://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/legaldocs/2015-12-08_PeeringDB_Bylaws.pdf">http://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/legaldocs/2015-12-08_PeeringDB_Bylaws.pdf</a>
define Membership:
</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal
business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 members of the Board of Directors, all of which are up for 
election this year.

The Bylaws proscribe staggered Board elections. Based on the BigPulse.com 
STV results, the top two candidates will get Board terms of 2 years, while 
the next three candidates will get Board terms of 1 year. Next year, there 
will be three seats up for election, all with 2 year terms.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2016: Candidates may submit their
candidacy and maximum 300 word statement, as determined by POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command,
or revisions to their statement, to
secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2016: Ballots, with candidate statements, will be submitted to the
PeeringDB Governance mailing list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>April 15th through 29th 23:59:59 UTC 2016: Voting.</p>

<p>
Hi - I'm Matt Griswold and I am currently Chairman and CTO for United
IX, an Internet exchange in Chicago. I have been coding and launching
technology companies since 1999. I am extremely passionate about
peering and Internet communities and have volunteered Euro-IX, NANOG,
Open-IX and PeeringDB.
</p>
<p>
I started providing coding support and upgrades for PeeringDB in 2011.
Shortly after, I became an admin to assist in answering support
tickets, and gain a better understanding of user base and the
feature/improvement requests being made. After gaining a good insight
to the use cases, I began writing PeeringDB 2.0 to fulfill many of the
community requests for features and improvements. Getting PeeringDB 2.0
in beta has been a huge step forward, but there is still a substantial
amount of work to complete the vision for 2.0. Along with adding new
functionality and data objects, I want to ensure we maintain data
validity and interoperate with other community resources such as IXF
and ixp-memberlist schema to make PeeringDB a one stop canonical source
for any business needs.
</p>
<p>
This is an exciting time for everyone involved with PeeringDB. As a
member of the board, I will focus my efforts implementing even more
features from the long queue of requests and ideas and stay deeply
involved with the community. I sincerely hope to have the opportunity
to continue to contribute any way I can, and drive progress as
PeeringDB evolves. Let's revolutionize how interconnection databases
work and make the world a better place!

<p>
I'm running again for the PeeringDB Board to be an advocate for users of the
platform. Now that PDB2.0 is out we have an opportunity to make the platform
more automated and user-friendly. After the smooth transition of PeeringDB to
its new governance framework we still will have to make sure that PeeringDB is
well funded and runs reliable services.
</p>
<p>
I've been a PeeringDB Admin for more than eight years. I've already worked in
the nooks and crannies of the platform, and know where we can improve it.
I've been very closely involved in the support functions of PeeringDB,
supporting queries for customer care. We need a reliable and responsive
support desk
</p>
<p>
As a member of the Board, I'd focus on making 2.0 a stable platform,
ensuring that we have all the features and data that our users need
to run their daily business.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB will be a primary source - globally - for accurate, updated
and standardized data about networks, IXPs, data centers, colocation
providers and more. I've been driving this process forward with all relevant
parties, and I'll work diligently to ensure all IXPs globally develop their
IXPA interface to make this a useful tool for the worldwide community.
</p>
<p>
I bring more than 25 years of experience and expertise in the ISP and
IXP industry. I'm co-founder and after 15 years as CTO/COO now an evangelist
of DE-CIX. I have a close eye on the global peering industry regularly
attending NANOG, DEnog, MENOG, APRICOT and other key global fora.
</p>
<p>
I love what I do, and I'd like to continue to serve this awesome industry
as a member of the PeeringDB Board of Directors.

<p>
PeeringDB is one of the most important online resources for network operators,
and as such I believe it should remain independent, free of charge, neutral and
foremost: a pragmatic tool for everyday use.
</p>
<p>
Through the years, I've built up useful experience leading and participating in
a number of community-driven projects such as the NLNOG RING, the NANOG
communications committee, the NLNOG association (as chairman), the RIPE
Database WG (as chairman) and the IETF (as contributor to international
standards). 
</p>
<p>
You can find a detailed overview here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobsnijders
</p>
<p>
I believe that for the board to maintain a balanced and fair view, multiple
facets of this industry should be represented: Content, IXP, Datacenter & IP
carrier.
</p>
<p>
As an architect for a global carrier I will contribute my perspective and help
extend the reach of PeeringDB to IP network operators world-wide.
</p>
<p>
I've helped run PeeringDB for the last several years, and I'm currently serving
as a member of its Board of Directors. I hope to be given the trust and
opportunity to continue to guide PeeringDB forward.
