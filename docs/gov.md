> 91 responses, of which 89 voted for the main question:

>  PeeringDB functions should be performed by:

>  - 35 votes, 39.33%: "An independent 501(C)(6) (Not for profit) PeeringDB,
>       with it's own elected board and members"

>  - 14 votes, 15.73%: "The existing global standards body OpenIX 501(C)(6)
>       (Not for profit)"

>  - 10 votes, 11.24%: "The existing regional organization NANOG 501(C)(3)
>       (Not for profit)"

>  - 30 votes, 33.71%: "I don't care just as long as PeeringDB keeps
>       working"

> That looks like a clear vote for independence, given that the number for
> independence is 45% more than the combined votes for OpenIX and NANOG.

> Based on this, we are going to continue working toward becoming an 
> independent non-profit corporation. In the interest of broad support, 
> this is going to be done with transparency and inclusion using the pdb-gov 
> mailing list. The plan:
