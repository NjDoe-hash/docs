*** PeeringDB Common Committee Charter Provisions: ***

#### Dispute resolution

If the committee handles an issue in a manner in which a user believes that their view has not been adequately considered, their first action should be to raise the concern with the Committee Chair for further consideration. If the dispute is between the user and the Committee Chair then the issue may alternatively be raised with the Committee Vice Chair. If the dispute cannot be resolved the matter may be brought forward to the PeeringDB Board.  The decision by the PeeringDB Board shall be final.

#### Committee Chair and Vice Chair

The committee elects their Chair and Vice Chair from among their members, subject to PeeringDB Board approval.  The Chair and Vice Chair work as a team and distribute the workload between themselves as they deem appropriate. Decisions should be unanimous, however the final decision on any matter is with the Chair. In case the Chair becomes unavailable, the Vice Chair may assume the position of Acting Chair. If the Chair or Vice Chair become permanently unavailable, replacement(s) are elected from the remaining committee members, subject to PeeringDB Board approval.
