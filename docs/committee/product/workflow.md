## Decision making process and workflow

Product Committee members are responsible for driving the development of PeeringDB. To do this, GitHub issues are used to track proposed and in progress work. Product Committee members play two roles in driving forward work: 

1) As a shepherd - responsible for driving consensus for a given issue
2) As a stakeholder - voting on a consensus that has been reached

Each Product Committee member will choose issues to shepherd to a decision. They will indicate responsibility for this task by assigning the issue to themselves and placing it in the Decide queue.

To decide whether we act on a given issue that has been reported, a stakeholder group will be formed. This group will consist of Product Committee members, who are responsible for representing the users of PeeringDB. A stakeholder group on a given issue must consist of at least three Product Committee members, including the shepherding member. 

Any Product Committee member can be a stakeholder in the decision on an issue. They become a stakeholder on a given issue by either commenting on the issue on GitHub or participating in discussion of the issue on the Product Committee Mailing list. It is up to the shepherding member to help reach a **unanimous consensus** within the stakeholder group on what should be done with the issue - including **not** acting on it. If and only if there are opposing views on how to proceed, and unanimous consensus cannot be reached by the stakeholder committee members, decisions fall to the entire Product Committee (see below).

The final proposal of how to resolve each issue, along with votes from stakeholders must be documented in the GitHub issue to be considered to have reached consensus. Product Committee members must document any offline discussion in the GitHub issue to ensure transparency of the discussion process.

Issues in the Decide queue are regularly reviewed by the Product Committee to make sure the most impactful issues are being moved along to resolution. All issues in the Decide queue will be reviewed in the monthly Product Committee call to ensure stakeholders have reached consensus and to give members who have not participated in the issue an opportunity to participate.

After an issue with consensus has been reviewed, Product Committee members who disagree with the proposal have five days after the monthly Product Committee call to vote against the proposed solution, otherwise the issue will move to the backlog.

For any issues where consensus cannot be reached, an issue may move forward only if a quorum of 50% or more of the Product Committee has no more than 25% of the quorum in opposition to the issue.
