PeeringDB Board of Directors Election April 15th through 29th 2016 UTC
</font></p>

<p>
Bylaws at <a href="http://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/legaldocs/2015-12-08_PeeringDB_Bylaws.pdf">http://docs.peeringdb.com/gov/legaldocs/2015-12-08_PeeringDB_Bylaws.pdf</a>
define Membership:
</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal
business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 members of the Board of Directors, all of which are up for 
election this year.

The Bylaws proscribe staggered Board elections. Based on the BigPulse.com 
STV results, the top two candidates will get Board terms of 2 years, while 
the next three candidates will get Board terms of 1 year. Next year, there 
will be three seats up for election, all with 2 year terms.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2016: Candidates may submit their
candidacy and maximum 300 word statement, as determined by POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command,
or revisions to their statement, to
secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2016: Ballots, with candidate statements, will be submitted to the
PeeringDB Governance mailing list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>April 15th through 29th 23:59:59 UTC 2016: Voting.</p>
