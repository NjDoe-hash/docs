</p>
<blockquote>
"A corporation, limited liability company, partnership or other legal business entity
may be a Member of the Corporation. Membership is determined by having both an active
PeeringDB.com account and an individual representative or role subscription to the PeeringDB
Governance mailing list: <a href="http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov">
http://lists.peeringdb.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/pdb-gov</a>"
</blockquote>

<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the
voting system. This means that you rank your candidate preferences from most preferred to
least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

<p>
There are 5 seats on the Board of Directors, 3 of which are up for 
election this year. A Director term is 2 years.
</p>

<p>The following schedule applies to Board elections:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Through April 14th 23:59:59 UTC 2021: Candidates may submit their candidacy and a maximum
300 word statement, as determined by the POSIX "LANG=en_US.UTF-8 wc -w" command, or revisions
to their statement, to secretary@peeringdb.com.</p>

<p>April 15th 2021: A voter registration form will be sent to the PeeringDB Governance mailing
list (pdb-gov@lists.peeringdb.com).
</p>

<p>April 15th through 29th 23:59 UTC 2021: Voting.  (Registrations received after April 28th
UTC are not guaranteed to be processed in time for the April 29th 23:59 UTC voting deadline.)</p>

<p>
Having been involved since the PeeringDB’s inception, I am impressed and proud that the PeeringDB has become vital to the Internet interconnection ecosystem. I cannot give enough thanks to the current board under Aaron’s leadership, and volunteers like Greg who do not get enough credit. It would be a deep honor to continue working with this group.
</p>
<p>
While the PeeringDB is amazing today, there is much more it could do to ease the lives of engineers and peering coordinators. I believe my long tenure with the PeeringDB, work with multiple IXPs, experience on other non-profit Internet-related boards, and decades working in the industry make me uniquely qualified to help.
</p>
<p>
My primary goals:
</p>
<p>
1. Ensure the neutrality of the PeeringDB and guarantee users control their records.
</p>
<p>
2. Provide a stable and secure platform.
</p>
<p>
3. Be responsive to user requests.
</p>
<p>
4. Add features.
</p>
<p>
The order is intentional. Features are important, but it must come after the other priorities. As an example, I fought to ensure importing data from IXF was opt-in. Some wanted to import all data automatically, without user request or input. I believe the admins / board should not decide what is best for you. It is your record, you should have complete control.
</p>
<p>
If you agree the platform must be vehemently agnostic, and leave no doubt users own their own records, then I am your champion.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, I would like to thank each of you for using the PeeringDB. The DB is only as useful as the members make it, and you have made it the most important repository of peering information on the Internet. It is truly humbling to have been involved in the canonical example of a grass-roots community effort showing value and bringing everyone together.
