<p>Job Snijders</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
PeeringDB is one of the most important online resources for network
operators, and as such I believe it should remain independent, free of
charge, neutral and foremost: a pragmatic tool for everyday use. The
Internet's foundational infrastructure needs directories to find each
other to facilitate interconnection, PeeringDB is a critical index.
</p>
<p>
I've now built up a few years of useful experience in leadership roles
in the NLNOG foundation, various NTT and OpenBSD open source projects,
the IETF, RIPE, and of course PeeringDB itself. I believe I can
positively contribute to the Internet ecosystem if I continue to serve
on the PeeringDB board.
</p>
<p>
I hope to be given the trust and opportunity for another term!
