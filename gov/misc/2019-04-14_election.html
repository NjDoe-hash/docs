<p>Each Member may submit one ballot.  We are employing Single Transferable Vote (STV) as the

least preferred.  You do not need to rank all the candidates.  A later ballot from a
representative of a Member will replace a previous ballot from the same Member.</p>

election this year. A Director term is 2 years.

I'm running again for the PeeringDB Board to be an advocate for users of the platform. Although PDB2.0 is out for three years still much support is needed. We also have an opportunity to make the platform more automated and user-friendly. The governance framework is in place and we were able to get PeeringDB well funded via a couple of generous sponsors.
</p>
<p>
I've been a PeeringDB Admin for more than 11 years. I've already worked in the nooks and crannies of the platform, and know where we can improve it. I've been very closely involved in the support functions of PeeringDB, supporting queries for customer care. We need a reliable and responsive support desk. Besides leading the Admin committee I help on the Product and Outreach Committees.
</p>
<p>
As a member of the Board, I'd focus on making 2.0 a stable platform, ensuring that we have all the features and data that our users need to run their daily business. Moreover I would also continue my work in the PDB Product and Outreach Committees.
</p>
<p>
PeeringDB will be a primary source - globally - for accurate, updated and standardized data about networks, IXPs, data centers, colocation providers and more. I've been driving this process forward with all relevant parties, and I'll work diligently to ensure all IXPs globally develop their IXPA interface to make this a useful tool for the worldwide community.
</p>
<p>
I bring 30 years of experience and expertise in the ISP and IXP industry. I'm co-founder and after 15 years as CTO/COO now an evangelist of DE-CIX. I have a close eye on the global interconnection industry regularly attending NANOG, RIPE, APRICOT and other key global fora.
</p>
<p>
I love what I do, and I'd like to continue to serve this awesome industry as a member of the PeeringDB Board.
