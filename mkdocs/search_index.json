A record can be a facility, an exchange point, or a network.  Users are added to the org entity and can then be given access to any facility, any network, any exchange point, or anything the org itself owns.\n\n\nAuthenticating via embedded user/pass in the URL\n\n\nSupport for this depends on the client and some browsers have stopped supporting embedded\n\nauthentication in the URL\n\n\nSo for example \n\n\nhttps://\nusername\n:\npassword\n@peeringdb.com/api/net/1\n\n\n\nmay work or it may not depending on the browser you are using.\n\n\nWhy are dates represented as strings in the API?\n\n\nDate strings are ISO 8601 to keep a standard format. Comparison operations such as \n__gt\n, \n__lt\n, etc all still work as expected. For fetching records against updated timestamp, you may also use \n?since=\nseconds since epoch\n\n\nHow do I sync the whole database to my local machine?\n\n\nYou may make a full local copy with \nhttps://github.com/peeringdb/peeringdb-py\n, see docs at \nhttp://peeringdb.github.io/peeringdb-py/cli/\n\n\nInitially it will perform full sync, then it will only do an incremental sync (only updates records that have changed), so you're free to run it as often as you want.\n\n\nWhen syncing to MySQL I get 'Illegal mix of collations'\n\n\nSuch as:\n\n\ndjango.db.utils.OperationalError: (1267, \"Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (utf8_general_ci,COERCIBLE) for operation '='\")\n\n\n\nWe will fix that when time allows, for the time being, just run:\n\n\nalter database peeringdb default character set utf8 default collate utf8_unicode_ci;",
